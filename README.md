# Blueberries

This is a machine learning exercise using the Wild Blueberry Yield dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/wild-blueberry-yield-prediction)

The objective is to use features such as the size of each blueberry clone (plant), how many bees are in the field, and weather data to predict the season's crop yield.
